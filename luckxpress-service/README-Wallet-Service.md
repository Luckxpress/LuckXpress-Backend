);
```

### 2. Promotional Credit (Sweeps)

WalletTransaction result = walletService.creditSweeps(
    userId, amount, promotionReference, reason
);
```

### 3. Game Bet
```java
// Lock funds for gameplay
walletOperationsService.lockFunds(userId, currency, betAmount, gameId);

// Debit for bet
WalletTransaction bet = walletService.debit(
    userId, currency, betAmount, gameId, "Game bet"
);
```

### 4. Game Win
```java
WalletTransaction win = walletOperationsService.processWin(
    userId, currency, betAmount, winAmount, gameId
);
```

### 5. Withdrawal (Sweeps Only)

    userId, amount, paymentMethod, bankAccountId
);
```

MIN_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT = $5
MAX_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT = $5,000
```

### Dual Approval
